                        <h1>DEAR MASAWARA FAMILY</h1>
                        <h3>February 18th, 2020</h3>
                        <p>New season’s greetings to you all</p>
                        <p>I wish that 2020 will be a year of tremendous growth for each of you as well as 
                            unprecedented development for the Masawara Group. The growth journey of our organization, as
                             it will be measured over the next five years, will reflect transformational prosperity even
                              in the face of all anticipated adversity. As you might have been updated by your leadership
                               teams, the Masawara Group has commenced a growth trajectory that has been defined after a series 
                               of strategy formulation meetings that involved all the Masawara units at various levels. At
                                our Masawara Leadership conference, we established the critical factors that will lead to a
                                 transformation of our organization. To achieve this transformation, we will invest in existing
                                  and new short to long term opportunities to create value for our
                             shareholders whilst enhancing our responsibility to make the lives of everyone we touch better.</p>
                             <p>Our strategy is simple. We will:</p>
                             <p>Invest astutely to build leadership positions in five critical growth sectors i.e. Financial services, Hospitality, Agriculture, Health and Energy. <br>
                                Technology and Innovation <br>
                                Leverage technology-enabled innovation to create exceptional and ground-breaking products and services <br>
                                People and Culture <br>
                                Invest in our people by attracting, retaining and training our staff to give them to capacity to implement and deliver the growth strategy <br>
                                Marketing, Innovation and Customer Experience <br>
                                Establish the Masawara brand as a reflection of African ingenuity, innovation, and belief. <br>
                                Undeniably, such ambitions are far-reaching and challenging. However, I have no doubt in our ability to achieve these goals that I believe to be common to us all, as you have never lacked courage in the past.
                                </p>
                                <p>As I reflect the commencement of this journey, my key deliverables are;</p>
                                <p>To make sure that over the next five years there is no one in our group whose life will not be better while working at Masawara. With this in mind, the transformation team tasked with focusing on People and Culture will be working with all the companies in the Group to periodically carry out surveys on what you all wish to see incorporated into our structures to make your lives significantly better. The goal is that within five years, Masawara will be Zimbabwe’s most admired group and employer.
                                    Bearing the above in mind, I would like us to intensify our efforts with a focus on delivering the Masawara 10x growth strategy. This shared vision will deliver returns to stakeholders within Masawara’s sphere of influence and amplify our presence nationally and regional wide. <br>
